# Golf

Little project put together on holiday with family, August of 2025. We were 
playing a card came, which I later found out was called golf, and I was mentally
trying to work out optimal strategies / the expected value of a hand by an entirely
rational player. Didn't go far in helping me win, but did lead me to write this...

Coded logic for game, and exploring different strategies.
